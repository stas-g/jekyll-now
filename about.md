I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student within the [Wallace Group](http://chr1swallace.github.io/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). I have a part-time role in [Ken Smith's](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/about-the-department/head-of-department/) group as Director of Genome Informatics. I used to be  Head of Genome Informatics at the [DIL](https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/), and was lucky to manage a team of three bioinformaticians, who were responsible for [ImmunoBase](http://www.immunobase.org) and [T1DBase](http://www.t1dbase.org), two widely used and cited human autoimmune genetic databases.
