I am Olly Burren currently a PhD student within the [Wallace Group](http://chr1swallace.github.io/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). I used to be  Head of Genome Informatics at the DIL, and was lucky to manage a team of three bioinformaticians, who were responsible for [ImmunoBase](http://www.immunobase.org) and [T1DBase](http://www.t1dbase.org), two widely used and cited human autoimmune genetic databases.
